# Presentation Coach!

This project was made in 24 hours by our team (Justin, Isaac, Brice). However, some changes were made after the competition.

The project earned us an honorable mention, only being 1 of 2 teams to do so.

## Future implementations
- Add a page that takes in the pptx file upload and mp4 file upload (for now it is done locally)
- Add a loading screen page
- Scale the project to work with multiple cameras from different angles to use in a larger classroom setting
